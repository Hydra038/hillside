# UK Product Catalog Cleanup - Final Summary

## Date: September 20, 2025

### Products Removed (Not Known/Common in UK):

#### ❌ **5 Products Removed:**
1. **Hornbeam Firewood - Premium** (£85.99)
   - Reason: Hornbeam extremely rare in UK firewood market, mainly used for tool handles
   
2. **Apple Cooking Wood - BBQ Grade** (£45.99)
   - Reason: Very niche market, most UK customers don't buy specialty cooking woods
   
3. **Cedar Kindling** (£29.99)
   - Reason: Cedar not common in UK, typically just called "kindling"
   
4. **Fire Starter Bundle** (£39.99)
   - Reason: UK market sells firelighters and kindling separately, not as "bundles"
   
5. **Campfire Bundle** (£49.99)
   - Reason: "Campfire" is American terminology, UK uses different terms

#### ❌ **2 Duplicates Removed:**
- **Premium Oak Firewood** (duplicate)
- **Mixed Hardwood Bundle** (duplicate)

#### ✏️ **1 Product Renamed:**
- **Silver Birch Logs** → **Birch Logs - Premium Grade**
  - Reason: "Silver birch" sounds decorative, UK market just says "birch"
