# Image Fix Documentation

## Problem
Product images were not displaying because the database contained incorrect image URLs that didn't match the actual files in `/public/images/products/`.

## Solution
Updated all product image URLs in the database to point to the correct files:

### Fixed Mappings:
- `/images/mixed-hardwood.jpg` → `/images/products/mixed-hardwood-softwood-logs.webp`
- `/images/birch-firewood.jpg` → `/images/products/premium-firewood.jpg`
- `/images/cherry-firewood.jpg` → `/images/products/premium-firewood.jpg`
- `/images/hickory-firewood.jpg` → `/images/products/premium-firewood.jpg`
- `/images/bulk-hardwood.jpg` → `/images/products/bulk-hardwood-logs-crate.webp`
- `/images/aged-oak.jpg` → `/images/products/oak-logs.jpg`
- `/images/compressed-logs.jpg` → `/images/products/premium-firewood-briquettes.jpg`

All product images now use the correct `/images/products/` path and reference existing files.
